# Compiling
## Linux

* delete MTA/x64/linux-libs/libstdc++.so.6
* install the lua library, `apt install liblua5.1-0-dev` on Ubuntu/Debian
* run `make`

Note if you plan to use this compiled module you must delete the included linux library provided by MTA as it contains older versions of Glibc incompatible with this. Requires version 'GLIBCXX_3.4.18'.

## Windows

* using visual studio, build the sln
